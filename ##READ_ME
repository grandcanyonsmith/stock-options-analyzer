what stills needs to be do;

1. We need to be albe to get data for any intrade ticks that we please
2. We theen need to format that data and it auto add it'self into tht google excel sheet
3. After test that data, we can come up with a better gage on when to set strick or less strick stop lossses
4. Be able to give the info we need with 20+ seonds with only insertng 3 data enpoints in less than 5 minutes.
5. Show avobe all our overall gainz/losses on the website. We aren't embarresed by perfomance. Work and time will always tell.

Phase ll
1.Create website where we can discplay data fields in chronoloical order for people to be able to see for themselves.
Guest list of 100 people will have the oppotunity to try it for free, then start paying $50/ month
2.Data will be uploaded as it comes in. Once the 20 stop loss has trigged, it will be mareket as good.
gold = new
grew = normal
green = traded and made proft
red = stop loss kicked in and were'nt profitabble
